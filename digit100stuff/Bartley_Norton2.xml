    <paragraph n="1">I received particular joy at seeing, within the smell of the land, <Norton background ="Yorkshire">an Old
        Yorkshire man</Norton> of foreseer who had left his <Norton son="true" job = "merchant">son a merchant in <loc>New York</loc></Norton>, <home left="true">to breath
        his last in his native land</home>; far from the <misfortune>continued storms</misfortune> we met &amp; <misfortune>feeble situation</misfortune> he
        was in from <misfortune>sea sickness</misfortune> I had been apprehensive we should have lost him on the passage. </paragraph>
    <paragraph n="2">Coasting the Southwest shore of <loc>Ireland</loc> on that <date>18th</date> in the evening
        we made Cork, where we were (sp. where) becalmed – we met there a ship we had seen two days
        before at a distance, she was an armed vessel of <loc>Liverpool</loc>, that had been at
            <loc>Barbados</loc>, and was now returning, she had on board the Governor, and suite of
        a Dutch settlement in the West Indies, lately taken by the British troops – There is not
        much appearance of verdure yet on shore – or it might in some respect afford a beautiful
        prospect – <mark crossedout="loops">but they have a disagreeable way of decorating their coasts with gibbets (sp.
        jibbets) here and there</mark> – Is it not surprising, that a people so enlightened, so humane and
        so polite should have it so arranged, that the first object striking the view of the
        strangers, who approach their <mark crossouted = "loops">shore</mark> should be an emblem of the severity of their laws and
        depravity of some of their people. Telegraphs were also to be seen on every eminence – this
        is a late invention to communicate intelligence of the approach of an enemy or to give
        orders to the ships of the Navy – they are on a line of communica-tion within distinct view
        of each other – certain figures are put up which are repeated from one (p.35) <telegraphs encoded = "true">to the other
        without being understood by any but those from <mark edit="added" color ="dark black">whom</mark> the orders issue and the commanders of
        Posts.</telegraphs> We there learnt, by the boats which came from the shore, that all was as yet
        tranquil, that they had only heard of the threats of Bonaparte which it was not likely, he
        would be able to put in execu-tion.</paragraph> <!--started marking up things that wouldnt seem revelant but could be usefull information during their time period-->
    <paragraph n="3">After night a fair wind springing up, <voyage>we made sail</voyage>, and next morning, we were
        abreast of <loc>Wicklow Moun-tains</loc>, the land is high and elevated, but we were at too great a
        distance to distinctly view it – On the <day>21st</day> we sailed along the <loc>Welsh Coast</loc> and passed
        <loc>Holyhead</loc> – here is elevated land &amp; lofty mountains, whose tops are covered with snow,
        which although they do not prepossess you with an idea of the fertility of the country, yet
        the natural Majestic grandeur of the asylum of the descendants of ancient Britons strikes
        the mind with veneration at the magnanimity and unfortunate valor of their ancestors who
        preferred breathing the air of freedom on Rocky Mountains, to remaining in subjection on
        their native fertile plains, and calls a sigh for their <hero>hero the gallant
        Caractacus.</hero></paragraph>
    <paragraph n="4"> In the evening a <person ship ="captain?" airplanes="unsure">Pilot</person> comes on board and next day we arrive safe in dock <!-- why is he called a pilot, was there planes in this time period? -->
        here, the pleasure we felt on the occasion can not well be imagined by any but those, who
        have made a long sea voyage. Altho’ this was <day>Sunday</day> and business lulled at rest,
        yet sufficient was to be seen to give a stranger some conception of the magnitude of the <!-- city was slow on sunday -->
        trade carried on at this place – <Structures Wealth = "alot" port = "trade port" >the many store houses, the multitude of ships, the inland<!--What is the importance of him going into so much detail about how slow the bussiness is -->
        canals and docks all denote wealth </Structures>&amp; exertion, <metaphor meaning="unsure">these last are of two kind wet and dry</metaphor>,
        the latter are to receive vessels to be repaired; the former are for (p.36) ships to unload
        and load in; they are made by digging spaces to such a level as to be of sufficient depth
        for the vessels that are to enter the gates of these docks at which the vessels, and flow of
        the tide are received, are shut in the ebb tide by which means the water is retained that
        keeps the ships afloat – were it not for these constructions the lading and unlading would
        be performed with great inconvenience at this port which is not naturally well calculated,
        the River being amazing shallow at low water, and its entry rendered difficult from a number
        of sand banks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph n="5"><mark rewritten = "loops">But the approximate situation of this place to several manufacturing town
        renders it the <loc trade="huge">great emporium of commerce to the West</loc> –</mark> It is here that are deposited the
        <products>stuffs</products> of <loc>Manchester</loc>, the <products>cutlery</products> of <loc>Birmingham</loc> and the <products>woolen cloths</products> of <loc>Yorkshire</loc>, as are
        also the produce of the west for which they are bartered – it is considered next to <loc>London</loc>
        for importance in trade: that of <loc>Africa</loc> however is a branch that is carried on here to some
        extent and is not honorable to the human spe-cies; for it is a barter of their fellow
        creatures – you must not by this imagine, that the slaves are brought here, no, for none
        would be slaves after they had breathed the British air – they are bought in Africa for
        coarse clothes, arms spirits &amp; taken to the West Indies and sold for the produce of
        these Islands, which is brought to this place &amp; from it taken to different parts of the
        country.</paragraph>
