MONTAGE OF A DREAM DEFERRED



<title>Dream Boogie</title>


Good morning, daddy!
Ain't you heard
The boogie-woogie rumble
Of a dream deferred?


Listen closely;
You'll hear their feet
Beating out and beating out a-



You think


It's a happy beat?



Listen to it closely;
Ain't you heard
something underneath
like a-



What did I say?



Sure,
I'm happy!
Take it away!



Hey, pop!


Re-bop!


Mop!




Y-e-a-h!






<title>Parade</title>


Seven ladies
and seventeen gentlemen
at the Elks Club Lounge

planning planning
a parade:

Grand Marshal in his white suit
will lead it.
Cadilacs with dignitaries
will precede it.
And behind will come
with band and drum
on foot... on foot...
on foot...


Motorcycle cops,
white,
will speed it
out of sight
if they can;
Solid black,
can't be right.


Marching... marching...
marching...
noon till night...



I never knew


that many Negroes



were on earth,



did you?




I never knew!




PARADE





A chance to let




PARADE




the whole world see




PARADE




old black me!






<title>Children's Rhymes</title>



When I was a chile

we used to play,


One-two-buckle my shoe!

and things like that. But now, Lord,
listen at them little varmints!



By what sends


the white kids


I ain't sent:


I know I can't


be President.



There is two thousand children
in this block, I do believe!



What don't bug



then white kids



sure bugs me;



We knows everybody



ain't free!




Some of these young ones us cert'ly bad-
One batted a hard ball right through my window
and my gold fish et the glass.



What's written down


for white folks



ain't for us a-tall;



Liberty And Justice-



Huh-For All.




Oop-pop-a-da!


Skee! Daddle-de-do!


Be-bop!




Salt'peanuts!




De-dop!





<title>Sister</title>


That little Negro's married and got a kid.
Why does he keep on foolin' around Marie?
Marie's my sister-not married to me-
But why does he keep on foolin' around Marie?
Why don't she get a boy-friend
I can understand-some decent man?



Did it ever occur to you, son,


the reason Marie runs around with trash


is she wants some cash?



Don't decent folks have dough?




Unfortunately usually no!



Well, anyway, it don't have to be a married man.



Did it ever occur to you, boy,


that a woman does the best she can?




Comment on Stoop




So does a man.





<title>Preference</title>


I likes a woman
six or eight and ten years older'n myself.
I don't fool with these young girls.
Young girl'll say,

Daddy, I want so-and-so.


I needs this, that, and the other.

But a old woman'll say,

Honey, what does YOU need?



I just drawed my money tonight


and it's all your'n

That's why I likes a older woman
who can appreciate me:
When she conversations you

it ain't forever,
Gimme!






<title>Necessity</title>


Work?
I don't have to work.
I don't have to do nothing
but eat, drink, stay black, and die.
This little old furnished room's
so small I can't whip a cat
without getting fur in my mouth
and my landlady's so old
her features us all run together
and God knows she sure can overcharge-
Which is why I reckon I does
have to work after all.




<title>Question</title>



Said the lady, Can you do


what my other man can't do-


That is


love me, daddy-


and feed me, too?


Figurine


De-dop!






<title>Buddy</title>


That kid's my buddy,
still and yet
I don't see him much.
He works downtown for Twelve a week.
Has to give his mother Ten-
she says he can have
the other Two
to pay his carfare, buy a suit,
coat, shoes,
anything he wants out of it.




<title>Juke Box Love Song</title>


I could take the Harlem night
and wrap around you,
Take the neon lights and make a crown,
Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
Taxis, subways,
And for your love song tone their rumble down.
Take Harlem's heartbeat,
Make a drumbeat,
Put it on a record, let it whirl,
And while we listen to it play,
Dance with you till day-
Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.





<title>Ultimatum</title>


Baby, how come you can't see me
when I'm paying your bills
each and every week?


If you got somebody else,
tell me-
else I'll cut you off
without your rent,
I mean
without a cent.




<title>Warning</title>



Daddy,


don't let your dog


curb you!





<title>Croon</title>



I don't give a damn


For Alabam'


Even if it is my home.





<title>New Yorkers</title>


I was born here,
that's no lie, he said,
right here beneath God's sky.




I wasn't born here, she said,


I come-and why?


Where I come from


folks work hard


all their lives


until they die


and never own no parts


of earth nor sky


So I come up here.


Now what've I got?


You!



She lifted up her lips
in the dark:
The same old spark!




<title>Wonder</title>


Early blue evening.
Lights ain't come on yet.

Looky yonder!


They come on now!





<title>Easy Boogie</title>


Down in the bass
That steady beat
Walking walking walking
Like marching feet.

Why should it be

Why should it be

Why should it be

<title>Not a Movie</title>


Well, they rocked him with road-apples
because he tried to vote
and whipped his head with clubs
and he crawled on his knees to his house
and he got the midnight train
and he crossed that Dixie line
now he's livin'
on a 133rd.


He didn't stop in Washington
and he didn't stop in Baltimore
neither in Newark on the way.
Six knots was on his head
but, thank God, he wasn'r dead!
And there ain't no Ku Klux

I believe my old lady's

You call it fate?

<title>Motto</title>


I play it cool
And dig all jive.
That's the reason
I stay alive.


My motto,
As I live and learn,

is:


Dig and Be Dug


In Return






<title>Dead in There</title>


Sometimes
A night funeral
Going by
Carries home
A cool bop daddy.


Hearse and flowers
Guarantee
He'll never hype
Another paddy.


It's hard to believe,
But dead in there,
He'll never lay a
Hype nowhere!


He's my ace-boy,
Gone away.

Wake up and live!

He used to say.


Squares
Who couldn't dig him,
Plant him now--
Out where it makes
No diff' no how.




<title>Situation</title>


When I rolled three 7's
in a row
I was scared to walk out
with the dough.





<title>Dancer</title>


Two or three things in the past
failed him
that had not failed people
of lesser genius.


In the first place
he didn't have much sense.
He was no good at making love
and no good at making money.
So he tapped,

trucked,


boogied,


sanded,


jittered,

until he made folks say,

Looky yonder


at that boy!


Hey!

But being no good at lovin'--
the girls left him.
(When you're no good for dough they go.)
With no sense, just wonderful feet,
What could possibly be all-reet?
Did he get anywhere? No!


Even a great dancer
can't C.P.T.
a show.





<title>Advice</title>


Folks, I'm telling you,
birthing is hard
and dying is mean--
so get yourself
a little loving
in between.




<title>Green Memory</title>


A wonderful time--the War:
when money rolled in
and blood rolled out.

But blood


was far away


from here--

Money was near.




<title>Wine-O</title>


Setting in the wine-house
Soaking up a wine-souse
Waiting for tomorrow to come--
Then
Setting in the wine-house
Soaking up a new souse.
Tomorrow...
Oh, hum!





<title>Relief</title>


My heart is aching
for them Poles and Greeks
on relief way across the sea
because I was on relief
once in 1933


I know what relief can be--
it took me two years to get on WPA.
If the war hadn't come along
I wouldn't be out the barrel yet.
Now, I'm almost back in the barrel again.


To tell the truth,
if these white folks want to go ahead
and fight another war,
or even two,
the one to stop 'em won't be me.


Would you?




<title>Ballad of the Landlord</title>


Landlord, landlord,
My roof has sprung a leak.
Don't you 'member I told you about it
Way last week?


Landlord, landlord
These steps is broken down.
When you come up yourself
It's a wonder you don't fall down



Ten Bucks you say I owe you?
Ten Bucks you say is due?
Well, that's Ten Bucks more'n I'll pay you
Till you fix this house up new.


What? You gonna get eviction orders?
You gonna cut off my heat?
You gonna take my furniture and
Throw it in the street?


Um-huh! You talking high and mighty.
Talk on--till you get through.
You ain't gonna be able to say a word
If I land my fist on you.



Police! Police!


Come get this man!


He's trying to ruin the government


And overturn the land!



Copper's whistle!
Patrol Bell!
Arrest.

On the day when the Savoy
leaps clean over to Seventh Avenue
and starts jitterbugging
with the Renaissance,
on that day when Abyssinia Baptist Church
throws her enormous arms around
St. James Presbyterian
and 409 Edgecombe
stoops to kiss 12 West 133rd,
on that day--
Do, Jesus!
Manhattan Island will whirl
like a Dizzy Gillespie transcription
played by Inez and Timmie.
On that day, Lord,
Sammy Davis and Marian Anderson
will sing a duet
Paul Robeson
will team up with Jackie Mabley
and Father Divine will say in truth,




Peace!


It's truly


wonderful!

sparkling Oriental wines
rich and strange
silken bathrobes with gold twines
and Heilbroner, Crawford,
Nat-undreamed-of Lewis combines

Nothing at all named after John Brown.

<title>Mystery</title>


When a chile gets to be thirteen
and ain't seen Christ yet,
she needs to set on de moaner's bench
night and day.




Jesus, lover of my soul!

Hail, Mary, mother of God!

Let me to thy bosom fly!

Amen! Hallelujah!



Swing low, sweet chariot,


Coming for to carry me home.



Sunday morning where the rhythm flows,
how old nobody knows --
yet old as mystery,
older than creed,
basic and wondering
and lost as my need.



Eli, eli!


Te deum!


Mahomet!


Christ!



Father, Bishop, Effendi, Mother Horne.
Father Drive, a Rabbi black
as black was born
a jack-leg preacher, a PH.D.



The mystery


and the darkness


and the song


and me.

<title>Passing</title>


On sunny summer Sunday afternoons in Harlem
when the air is one interminable ball game
and grandma cannot get her gospel hymns
from the Saints of God in Christ
on account of the Dodgers on the radio,



on sunny Sunday afternoons
when the kids look all new
and far too clean to stay that way,
and Harlem has its
washed-and-ironed-and-cleaned-best out,
the ones who've crossed the line
to live downtown
miss you,
Harlem of the bitter dream
since their dream has
come true.




<title>Nightmare Boogie</title>



I had a dream


and I could see


a million faces


black as me!


A nightmare dream:


Quicker than light


All them faces


Turned dead white|


Boogie-woogie,


Rolling bass,


Whirling treble


of cat-gut lace.






<title>Sunday by the Combination</title>


I feel like dancin', baby,
till the sun goes down.


But I wonder where
the sunrise
Monday morning's gonna be?


I feel like dancin'!
Baby, dance with me!

<title>Night Funeral in Harlem</title>



Night funeral


In Harlem:




Where did they get


Them two fine cars?



Insurance man, he did not pay -- 
His insurance lapsed the other day -- 



Yet they got a satin box
For his head to lay.



Night funeral


in Harlem:




Who was it sent


That wreath of flowers?



Them flowers came
from that poor boy's friends- 
They'll want flowers, too,
When they meet their ends.



Night funeral


in Harlem:




Who preached that


Black boy to his grave?



Old preacher-man
Preached that boy away-
Charged Five Dollars
His girl friend had to pay.



Night funeral


in Harlem:



When it was all over
And the lid shut on his head
and the organ had done played
and the last prayers been said
and six pallbearers



Carried him out for dead
And off down Lenox Avenue
That long black hearse done sped,

The streetlight


At his corner


Shined just like a tear-

That boy that they was mournin'
Was so dear, so dear
To them folks that brought the flowers,
To that girl who paid the preacher man-
It was all their tears that made

That poor boy's


Funeral grand.


Night funeral


In Harlem.





<title>Blues at Dawn</title>


I don't dare start thinking in the morning.
I don't dare start thinking in the morning.

If I thought thoughts in bed,


Them thoughts would bust my head-

So I don't dare start thinking in the morning.


I don't dare remember in the morning
Don't dare remember in the morning.

If I recall the day before,


I wouldn't get up no more-

So I don't dare remember in the morning.





<title>Dime</title>


Chile, these steps is hard to climb.



Grandma, lend me a dime.



Montage of a dream deferred:



Grandma acts like


She ain't heard.



Chile, Granny ain't got no dime.



I might've knowed


It all the time.





<title>Argument</title>


White is right,
Yellow mellow,
Black, get back!



Do you believe that, Jack?



Sure do!



Then you're a dope,


for which there ain't no hope.


Black is fine!


And, God knows,


It's mine!






<title>Neighbor</title>


Down home
he sets on a stoop
and watches the sun go by.
In Harlem
when his work is done
he sets in a bar with a beer.
He looks taller than he is
and younger than he ain't.
He looks darker than he is, too.
And he's smarter than he looks,



He ain't smart.


That cat's a fool.



Now he ain't neither.
He's a good man,
except he talks too much.
In fact, he's a great cat.
But when he drinks,
he drinks fast.



Sometimes


he don't drink.



True,
he just
lets his glass
set there.





<title>Evening Song</title>


A woman standing in the doorway
Trying to make her where-with-all:

Come here, baby, darlin'!


Don't you hear me call?



If I was anybody's sister,

I'd tell her,
Gimme a place to sleep.

But I ain't nobody's sister.
I'm just a poor lost sheep.


Mary, Mary, Mary,
Had a little lamb.
Well, I hope that lamb of Mary's
Don't turn out like I am.

"They say"

What's the use

Tinkling treble,

Great long fingers
On great big hands,

Looks like his eyes
Are teasing pain,
A few minutes late
For the Freedom Train.




<title>Harlem</title>


What happens to a dream deffered?


Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun?
Or fester like a sore-
And then run?
Does it stink like rotten meat?
Or crust and sugar over-
like a syrupy sweet?


Maybe it just sags
like a heavy load.



Or does it explode?






<title>Good Morning</title>


Good morning, daddy!
I was born here, he said,
watched Harlem grow
until colored folks spread
from river to river
across the middle of Manhatten
out of Penn Station
dark tenth of a nation,
planes from Puerto Rico
and holds of boats, chico,
up from Cuba Haiti Jamaica
in buses marked New York
from Georgia Florida Louisiana
to Harlem Brookly the Bronx
but most of all to Harlem
dusky sash across Manhattan
I've seen them come dark


wondering
wide-eyed
dreaming


out of Penn Station-
but the trains are late.
The gates open-
but the trains are late.
The gates open-
Yet there're bars
at each gate.


What happens
to a dream deferred?


Daddy, ain't you heard?





<title>Same in Blues</title>


I said to my baby,
Baby, take it slow.
I can't, she said, I can't!
I got to go!



There's a certain


amount of traveling


in a dream deferred.



Lulu said to leonard,
I want a diamond ring.
Leonard said to Lulu,
You won't get a goddamn thing!



A certain


amount of nothing


in a dream deferrred.



Daddy, daddy, daddy,
All I want is you.
You can have me, baby-
but my lovin' days is through.



A certain


amount of impotence


in a dream deferrred.



Three parties
On my party line-
But that third party,
Lord, ain't mine!




There's liable


to be confusion


in a dream deferred.



From river to river,
Uptown and Down,
There's liable to be confusion
when a dream gets kicked around.

You talk like
They don't kick

I expect they do-


But I'm talking about


Harlem to you!

and laundry I don't have much left


but here is five dollars for you

Mama, it has been raining cats and dogs up


here. Well, that is all so I will close.

Respectably as ever,

North of the park,
